How to solve a DSGE model with dolo ?
-------------------------------------

Dolo is a tool to assist researchers in solving several types of DSGE models, using either local of global approximation methods.

Users are (encourag√©) to separate the definition of their models from the solution algorithm. A simple syntax is
provided by YAML files to define variables and equations of several types.

Dolo then checks consistency of the model and computes a numerical representation.
