Model conventions
=================

This page describes how models are specified in dolo.

Model types
+++++++++++

There are several ways to represent a DSGE model. Here we list some of them:

state-free approach
-------------------

This approach is taken in Dynare and in most perturbation softwares. The model is specified by a vectorial function

:math:`f(y_{t+1},y_t,y_{t-1},\epsilon_t) = 0`

with the restriction that :math:`\epsilon_t` and :math:`y_{t+1}` cannot appear in the same equations.
For this kind of models, the solver finds a solution :math:`g` such that the law of motion of :math:`(y_t)` is given by: :math:`y_t = g \left( y_{t-1}, \epsilon_t \right)`

controlled process variants
---------------------------

With these versions, the state-space is chosen by the user. A law of motion for the state-space must be specified (depending on the controls and on the shocks). And optimality conditions must be given to pin down all the controls.
The model is specified by giving :math:`g` and :math:`f` such that:

:math:`s_t = g \left( s_{t-1}, x_{t-1}, \epsilon_t \right)`

:math:`E_t \left[ f \left( s_t, x_t, s_{t+1}, x_{t+1} \right) \right]=0`

In some cases, some variables can be directly expressed as a function of other variables. We call them *auxiliary* variables. Auxiliary variables are restricted
to depend only on contemporaneous variables (controls or states).  The model can be rewritten:

:math:`a_t = a\left(s_t, x_t\right)`

:math:`s_t = g \left( s_{t-1}, x_{t-1}, a_{t-1}, \epsilon_t \right)`

:math:`E_t \left[ f \left( s_t, x_t, a_t, s_{t+1}, x_{t+1}, a_{t+1} \right) \right]`



A sub-variant of this specification let the user choose equations to define expectations. This is useful for PEA approaches. The model is specified by giving :math:`g`, :math:`f` and :math:`h` such that:

:math:`s_t = g \left( s_{t-1}, x_{t-1}, \epsilon_t \right)`

:math:`f \left( s_t, x_t, z_t \right)`

:math:`z_t = E_t h \left( s_{t+1}, x_{t+1} \right)`
